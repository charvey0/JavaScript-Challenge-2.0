# JavaScript-Challenge-2.0

## Description

The following application is a webpage application that will offer the user an opportinity to test their JavaScript knowledge.

The reason this is called JS Challenge 2.0 is because I completely rewrote this from scratch with all the lessons I learned while working on the first one.

When the user opens the webpage, they will see a set of rules on how a score will be generated.  When the quiz begins, a timer will be set to 60 seconds.  The score increase by 1 point for each correct answer and the time decreases by 5 seconds for each incorrect answer.  When time expires, the user will be prompted to enter their name and be notified if they scored high enough to make it into the top ten scores (the Hall of Fame).  Their scores (previous and current) will be highlighted in a display of all scores.

## Technologies

I used JavaScript and jQuery primarily in addition to HTML and CSS with Bootstrap. 

## What I learned:

* I learned that organization and code clarity is really important
* I found a bunch of online resources for javascript and jQuery
* I had to refine my process for updating code from jumping around from block to block to a more systematic process
* I also discovered the benefit of commits.  I only saw the benefit of sharing the project through GitHub.  Now I also see the benefit of being able to start at a point before the code you wrote irreparably broke your application and now you are sitting there at 3 in the morning trying to find out why it doesn't work anymore... or so I've heard.
* I learned how to use a timer, but still need to work on it.
* I also learned a lot about event listeners and that several of the same kind can be assigned to an element.  I might need that later.
* I have discovered that not all websites designed to help learning developers are as helpful as others.

## What I want to know more about:

* I want to explore the idea of creating a template project with everything I use on most projects - like my file structure with links and Bootstrap and jQury links.
* I also want to be more proficient with Bootstrap and jQuery.
* When I have time, I would like to find my go-to resources for the above technologies.
* I want to find out more about using HTML and CSS templates to start a project. 

## What I struggled with:

I had a difficult time focusing on one part of the project at a time.  When I was in testing, I would notice like 4 things I wanted to fix, but they were all over the place in the code.  The next time I tested, I was trying to find out which "fix" messed it all up.  It was painful...

I also struggled more that I thought I would with the empty files at the start of the project.  My mind went blank when there was nothing to start with.  I did work through it with pseudocode.  ...and coffee  ...and counseling.
